      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">4.1 Project-Specific Requirements</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white/90">
        Major infrastructure projects like the Melbourne Metro Tunnel often establish their own site-specific requirements through their Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBAs) and safety management systems that may exceed minimum legal requirements.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4 text-white/90">
        The Cross Yarra Partnership (CYP) - the consortium responsible for building the twin tunnels and five new stations - manages the construction phase of the Melbourne Metro Tunnel Project and may impose additional requirements beyond general legislation.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">4.2 Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) Considerations</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-white/90">
        While the CFMEU (Victorian Construction and General Division) Enterprise Agreement 2024-2027 template does not specifically address VOC requirements for portable light towers, individual project agreements or site-specific annexures may contain such provisions.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4 text-white/90">
        Project-specific EBAs can legally establish requirements that exceed statutory minimums, and such requirements would be legally binding on parties covered by those agreements.
